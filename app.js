/*
1. What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
A parameter is added to the beginning of a function as a placeholder - function name (param, param) and arguments are values you use when you invoke the function.

2. Within a function, what is the difference between **return** and **console.log**?
return saves a value that can be used later on. Console.log doesn't save anything, but prints out the result.

3. What are the implications of the ability of a function to return a value?
You can use that returned value in your other functions or later in your code.
